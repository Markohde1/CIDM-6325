# Code Repository for CIDM6325

## Fall 2020

We will work through Antonio Mel√©'s [Django By Example - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/django-3-by-example-third-edition) Applications Together:

* Building a Blog
* Building a Social Website
* Building an Online Shop (eCommerce)
* Building a Chat Server using an API

I encourage you to hand-code from the book and resist the temptation to just copy and paste from the source files.

## Build a Blog Notes

Here are observations and notes from the chapters

### Chapter 1 - Build a Blog

---

* Make sure you install the latest version of any software the author refers to
    * For Python, you can go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
    * For any packages, such as [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), you can consult the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)
    * There are altneratives for **Virtual Environment** implementation, but making one is necessary regardless:
        * The book mentions `venv` which is a part of the standard Python 3.x install.  Note that the command is run like this: `python -m venv`
        * You can also install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) which is popular among the data science community.  I have started to use `miniconda` more lately.
    * **Virtual Environments** make a localized copy of Python and any libraries you use for your application so that they are separated from other applications.
        * virtual environments must be enabled and disabled
        * These are all command-line activities and I will be demonstrating this
    * **CLI options**:
        * _Windows_: I recommend that you install [Git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and use the **GitBash** command-line tool that comes with it
        * _Mac_: The built-in `terminal` App will work
        * **VS Code**: In all cases, try to do your terminal work from within VSCode's built-in terminal.

#### Models

With `Django` you are persisting business data using [Object/Relational Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping), which is a fairly standard approach to web application development.

This is there to structure your database.  Django Models are classes.  Review the basic structures and provisions of the [Python language](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp).

#### Admin

A great feature of Django is the built-in admin interface - you can perform CRUD operations here.

#### Queries

There is a built-in query expression structure that saves time and avoids the need to write SQL directly in most cases.

#### Views

We will try to use Class-Based-Views as much as possible.  However, Function-Based-Views are also possible.

#### Secret Key

Django uses a SECRET_KEY for many security purposes in your project.  Since I will be encouraging the use of Github, publishing your secret key is a problem to avoid.  In fact, if you look at this repository, the initial commit contains a secret key (since changed).

Relevant part of the documentation: [The secret key must be a large random value and it must be kept secret.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/deployment/checklist/#secret-key)

Also, since we'll use Git and Github, placing an effective GITIGNORE file into our repository is important: [Gitignore for a Django project](https://djangowaves.com/tips-tricks/gitignore-for-a-django-project/)

#### Templates

Templates are HTML files with escapes to contain minimal display and presentation logic.  The _beauty_ of your pages will completely rely on one of a few options:
* Your skill with CSS
* Use of a robust component library
* Some template you find/purchase
